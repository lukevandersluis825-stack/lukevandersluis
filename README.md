# Study Hours Estimator

A small command-line program that asks how many hours you studied today, estimates your total study time for the week (daily hours × 7), and prints the result. This helps you quickly track whether you are on pace to meet weekly study goals.

How to run
- From the repository root:

```bash
python3 python_github_assignment/app.py
```

Example interaction

```
How many hours did you study today? 2
You are on track to study 14.00 hours this week based on 2.00 hours/day.
```

Notes
- The script includes basic error handling: if you enter a non-numeric value it will print an error message and exit.
